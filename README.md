# Academic portfolio from Gilles Kratzer

The poster and presentations speaks mainly about my research projects which includes variables and models selection, Bayesian inference, network modelling, multivariate analysis. They are mainly related to my R packages:

- [varrank](https://cran.r-project.org/package=varrank)
- [abn](https://cran.r-project.org/package=abn)
- [mcmcabn](https://cran.r-project.org/package=mcmcabn)
